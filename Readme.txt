This project is a compilation of my source code for solving project euler problems.
The code is mostly in C/C++ and generally requires good tricky mathematics to solve.
It is an excellent way to test and improve algorithmic skills as the problems are very 
much of challenging nature.

The problems for Project Euler can be accessed at
